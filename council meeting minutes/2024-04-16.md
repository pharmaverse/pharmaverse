# Attendees

Various - as this summary covers a collation of the Q1 and April council meetings.

# Meeting notes
- pharmaverse council decision to accept two applications for new council members. To be announced soon in the pharmaverse blog.
- During Q1 of 2024 the pharmaverse council continued working on the following:
  - Purpose: [Inside the pharmaverse](https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/posts/2024-03-04_inside_the__phar.../inside_the__pharmaverse.html).
  - Onboarding the community: [Tips for First Time Contributors](https://pharmaverse.github.io/blog/posts/2024-03-11_tips_for__first_.../tips_for__first__time__contributors.html).
  - Communication & Engagement: Decision to consolidate and simplify the structure of the pharmaverse Slack channels so that it can meet the needs of the community.
  - Approach for competing packages: We’ll always try to encourage developer teams combining forces, but when not possible then ultimately our community of users would decide on the best solutions, as we’re targeting a curated list but not overly opinionated. Any exclusions or non-acceptance to pharmaverse will be transparently communicated.
