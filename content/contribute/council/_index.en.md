**Council Structure**

The initial Council was comprised of 1 representative from each of Roche, GSK, Atorus, and Janssen/J&J.
During 2023 and 2024, the Council expanded by 3 organizations, the first being Novo Nordisk followed by Appsilon and Sanofi.
In 2025, Novartis joined the Council.
Each council member puts forward one representative for a 2-year commitment. At the start of each subsequent year,
any Council member organization with an expiring commitment may remain on the Council with a renewed 2-year commitment. If a Council member organization leaves, 
they will be replaced by another Organization with one representative and a 2-year commitment. There is no restriction on the type of organization that may be
part of the Council (e.g., pharma, CRO, vendor, or regulatory). In the event of a vacancy on the Council, any Council member may nominate a replacement
organization to fill the vacancy. Alternatively, any organization believing they could make an impact (and able to meet the expectations below) could reach out
to any Council member to apply. Acceptance to the Council 2-year term is granted by the existing council, inclusive of outgoing membership.

It is expected that a Council member organization contribute:
*	One representative to the Council
*	Commitment to at least 2 open source packages under pharmaverse via reviews, hands-on code development, product leads, or other roles which contribute to the 
design, development, testing, release, and/or maintenance

Any council member organization must fulfill our DE&I (Diversity, Equity & Inclusion) criteria as outlined below:

Pharmaverse is committed to establishing a diverse council that effectively represents the community members with whom it engages. To be considered for inclusion in the council as a sponsor organization, organizations must meet at least two of the criteria listed below.

*	Renders (or delegates the rendering of) the 'curated' element of 'a curated set of packages'
*	Sets the strategy for pharmaverse
