[According to CDISC:](https://www.cdisc.org/standards/foundational/adam) ADaM defines dataset and metadata standards that support:

* efficient generation, replication, and review of clinical trial statistical analyses, and
* traceability among analysis results, analysis data, and data represented in the Study Data Tabulation Model (SDTM).â€‹

ADaM is one of the required standards for data submission to FDA (U.S.) and PMDA (Japan).

Our recommended packages for ADaM belong to the admiral family of packages. These consist of a core package covering common
analysis needs and a growing suite of therapeutic area specific package extensions.
