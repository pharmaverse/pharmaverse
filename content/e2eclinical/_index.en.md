This list encapsulates all the open source R packages (and codebases from other open source languages) that we have found that fall under the scope of usage for end-to-end clinical reporting in pharma.

We recommend users to also check out our [end-to-end examples](https://pharmaverse.github.io/examples/) as these show how the various packages listed can be used in conjunction to solve common clinical reporting challenges.
